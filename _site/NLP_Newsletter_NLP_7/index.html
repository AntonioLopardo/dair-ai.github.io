<p><br />
Welcome to the 7th issue of the NLP Newsletter. I hope you are having a wonderful day and that you and your loved ones are safe in these difficult times. We decided to publish this newsletter to bring some joy to our readers so please read when you have free time. For now, let’s keep focused on the things that are of top priority— our families and friends. ❤️ 💛 💚</p>

<p><br />
<strong><em>A few updates about the NLP Newsletter and dair.ai</em></strong>
All French and Chinese translations for the previous issues of the NLP Newsletter are now <a href="https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_newsletter">available</a>. Find out how you can contribute to the translation of previous and upcoming issues of the NLP Newsletter at this <a href="https://github.com/dair-ai/dair-ai.github.io/issues/11">link</a>.</p>

<p><br />
We recently created two GitHub repositories that contain <a href="https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries">NLP paper summaries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dair-ai/pytorch_notebooks">PyTorch notebooks</a> to get you started with neural networks.</p>

<h1 id="research-and-publications-">Research and Publications 📙</h1>

<p><strong><em>Measuring Compositional Generalization</em></strong></p>

<p><br />
In the context of machine learning, compositional generalization is the ability to learn to represent meaning and in turn sequences (novel combinations) from what’s learned in the training set. To this date, it is not clear how to properly measure compositionality in neural networks. A Google AI team <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/measuring-compositional-generalization.html">proposes</a> one of the largest benchmarks for compositional generalization using tasks such as question answering and semantic parsing. The picture below shows an example of the proposed model using atoms (produce, direct, etc.) to produce novel compounds, i.e., combinations of atoms. The idea of this work is to produce a train-test split that contains examples that share similar atoms (building blocks to generate examples) distribution but different compound distribution (the composition of atoms). The authors claim that is a more reliable way to test for compositional generalization.</p>

<strong><em>Fine-Tuning Pretrained Language Models: Weight Initializations, Data Orders, and Early Stopping</em></strong></p>

<p><br />
Researchers ran a comprehensive <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06305">set of fine-tuning trials</a> to better understand the effect of weight initialization and early stopping in the performance of language models. Through various experiments that involved fine-tuning BERT hundreds of times, it was found that distinct random seeds produce very different results. In particular, the study reports that some weight initialization does perform well across a set of tasks. All the experimental data and trials were publicly released for other researchers that are interested in further understanding different dynamics during fine-tuning.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><em>Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits</em></strong></p>

<p><br />
OpenAI researchers published a <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/">piece</a> discussing the state of interpretability of neural networks and the proposal of a new approach to interpreting them. Inspired by cellular biology, the authors delve deep into understanding vision models and what they learn by inspecting the weights of neural networks. Essentially, the study presented a few claims along with collected evidence that they believe could pave the way to better interpret neural networks.</p>

<strong><em>NLP Research Highlights — Issue #1</em></strong></p>

<p><br />
In a new dair.ai series called <a href="https://medium.com/dair-ai/nlp-newsletter-bertology-primer-fastpages-t5-data-science-education-pytorch-notebooks-slow-8ae5d499e040">NLP Research Highlights</a>, we provide detailed descriptions of current interesting and important NLP research. This will serve as a way to keep track of NLP progress via approachable summaries of these works. In the first quarterly issue, topics range from improving language models to improving conversational agents to state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. These summaries will also be maintained <a href="https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries">here</a>.</p>

<strong><em>Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks</em></strong></p>

<p><br />
In the past few months, we have been featuring a lot about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) due to their effectiveness not only in NLP but in other areas such as genomics and materials. In a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09405">paper</a>, researchers propose a general framework based on graph networks that is able to learn simulations in different domains such as fluids and deformable materials. The authors claim that they achieve state-of-the-art performance across different domains and that their general-purpose approach is potentially the best-learned physics simulator to date. Experiments include the simulation of materials such as goop over water and other interactions with rigid obstacles. They also tested a pre-trained model on out-of-distribution tasks and found promising results that show the generalization of the framework to larger domains.</p>

<strong><em>Toward Human-Centered Design for ML Frameworks</em></strong></p>

<p><br />
Google AI <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/toward-human-centered-design-for-ml.html">published</a> the results of a large-scale survey of 645 people who used TensorFlow.js. They aimed to find out from non-ML software developers what are the most important features and their overall experience with using current ML frameworks. Findings include that the “lack of conceptual understanding of ML” hinders the use of ML frameworks for this particular set of users. Participants in the study also reported the need for better instructions on how to apply the ML models to different problems and more explicit support for modification.</p>

<strong><em>Introducing DIET: state-of-the-art architecture that outperforms fine-tuning BERT and is 6X faster to train</em></strong></p>

<p><br />
DIET (Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) is a natural language understanding (NLU) multitask architecture <a href="https://blog.rasa.com/introducing-dual-intent-and-entity-transformer-diet-state-of-the-art-performance-on-a-lightweight-architecture/">proposed</a> by Rasa. The framework focuses on multitask training to improve results on both intent classification and entity recognition. Other benefits of DIET include the ability to use any of the current pre-trained embeddings such as BERT and GloVe. However, the focus was to provide a model that improves the current state-of-the-art performance on those tasks and is faster to train (6X speedup reported). The model is available in the <a href="https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/1.8.0/nlu/components/#dietclassifier">Rasa Open Source python library</a>.</p>

Berkeley is publicly releasing the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp20/home">entire syllabus</a> for its course on “Deep Unsupervised Learning” mainly focusing on the theoretical aspects of self-supervised learning and generative models. Some topics include latent variable models, autoregressive models, flow models, and self-supervised learning, to name a few. Youtube videos and slides are available.</p>

<p><br />
We also found this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fdw0ax/d_advanced_courses_update/">impressive list</a> of advanced online courses on machine learning, NLP and deep learning.</p>

<p><br />
And here is another course called <a href="https://compstat-lmu.github.io/lecture_i2ml/index.html">“Introduction to Machine Learning</a>” which includes topics such as supervised regression, performance evaluation, random forests, parameter tuning, practical advice, and much more.</p>

<p>The previous NLP Newsletter (Issue #6) is available <a href="https://medium.com/dair-ai/nlp-newsletter-bertology-primer-fastpages-t5-data-science-education-pytorch-notebooks-slow-8ae5d499e040">here</a>.</p>

<p><br />
Connon Shorten published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWu7j1nb_jI&amp;feature=emb_logo">video</a> explaining the ELECTRA model which proposes a technique called replaced token detection to pre-train Transformers more efficiently. If you are interested, we also wrote a short summary of the model <a href="https://medium.com/dair-ai/nlp-research-highlights-cd522b21b01a">here</a>.</p>

<p><br />
Rachael Tatman is working on a new series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G36q8_cYsc&amp;feature=emb_logo">NLP for Developers</a> where the idea is to talk more in-depth about different NLP methods, when to use them and explaining common issues that you may run into.</p>

<p><br />
DeepMind releases <a href="https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y">AlphaGo — The Movie</a> on YouTube to celebrate the 4th anniversary of AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol at the game of Go.</p>

<p><br />
OpenMined has <a href="https://blog.openmined.org/introducing-openmined-research/">open positions</a> for Research Engineer and Research Scientist roles which is a good opportunity to get involved with privacy-preserving AI.</p>
